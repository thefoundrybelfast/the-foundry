#The Foundry is a new Coworking space based in Belfast.

The Foundry is much more than just a desk and internet access, itâ€™s an energising environment that fosters collaboration in a shared and supportive space. We offer the flexibility of a range of Coworking options designed to facilitate part time and full time entrepreneurs

The Foundry is a space that is both vibrant and creative. It is an environment that provides engagement, synergy and increased productivity amongst a community of service providers, early stage start-ups and independent professionals who often find themselves working in isolation.

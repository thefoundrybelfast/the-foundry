<p>The Foundry offers a bespoke mentoring service for client companies, providing advice, insight and direction to help take companies to the next level. Mentoring is a priceless resource for any new business and can make a fundamental difference to the success or failure or an organisation. Please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@thefoundrybelfast.com">hello@thefoundrybelfast.com</a> to enquire about costs for our one-on-one mentoring service.</p>

<p>As with everything in life, having the right people around you can make a fundamental 
difference to the success or failure of what you do. We provide our companies 
with regular access to mentors who have been there and done it, offering up one on one 
personal business mentoring to all our tenant companies and if we don’t have a mentor on our 
list that fits your needs, we'll find one.</p>

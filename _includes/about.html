<h2>What we offer</h2>

<p>The Foundry has been built with our clients in mind.</p> 

<p>We’ve specifically designed a stylish yet functional environment that manages to blend privacy with collaboration, offering space for 15 hot desks, two bespoke offices for small organisations; making this a truly incredible space for start ups, entrepreneurs and small businesses.</p>

<h3>Bespoke Studio</h3>
<p> The Foundry also offers up a bespoke studio space for creatives who require that little bit extra, featuring a unique desk layout tailored specifically for artists, designers and those who need that little bit more space for design and paper based work.</p>
